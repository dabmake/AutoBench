analyzing CPU 0:
  driver: cpufreq-dt
  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0 1 2 3
  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0 1 2 3
  maximum transition latency: 80.0 us.
  hardware limits: 408 MHz - 1.51 GHz
  available frequency steps: 408 MHz, 600 MHz, 816 MHz, 1.01 GHz, 1.20 GHz, 1.30 GHz, 1.39 GHz, 1.51 GHz
  available cpufreq governors: interactive, conservative, userspace, powersave, ondemand, performance
  current policy: frequency should be within 600 MHz and 1.39 GHz.
                  The governor "ondemand" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency is 1.30 GHz (asserted by call to hardware).
