analyzing CPU 0:
  driver: cpufreq-dt
  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0 1 2 3
  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0 1 2 3
  maximum transition latency: 40.0 us.
  hardware limits: 408 MHz - 1.42 GHz
  available frequency steps: 408 MHz, 600 MHz, 816 MHz, 1.01 GHz, 1.20 GHz, 1.42 GHz
  available cpufreq governors: conservative, ondemand, userspace, powersave, interactive, performance
  current policy: frequency should be within 408 MHz and 1.42 GHz.
                  The governor "performance" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency is 1.42 GHz.
