analyzing CPU 0:
  driver: scpi-cpufreq
  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0 1 2 3
  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0 1 2 3
  maximum transition latency: 200 us.
  hardware limits: 100.0 MHz - 1.54 GHz
  available frequency steps: 100.0 MHz, 250 MHz, 500 MHz, 1000 MHz, 1.30 GHz, 1.54 GHz
  available cpufreq governors: conservative, userspace, powersave, ondemand, performance, schedutil
  current policy: frequency should be within 500 MHz and 1.54 GHz.
                  The governor "conservative" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency is 1.30 GHz (asserted by call to hardware).
  cpufreq stats: 100.0 MHz:0.19%, 250 MHz:0.58%, 500 MHz:55.49%, 1000 MHz:4.06%, 1.30 GHz:1.41%, 1.54 GHz:38.26%  (77201)
